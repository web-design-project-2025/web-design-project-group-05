            Hej! We are Alina, Anna and Lidia, three students who are currently
            studying in Sweden.<br />This website started as part of a
            university project. The goal was to build a recipe platform and
            since we all enjoy cooking and baking a lot, it quickly became
            something we were super excited about. We focused on creating a
            simple and accessible space where everyone can find inspiration and
            try out new ideas in the kitchen. We hope that the collection of
            recipes offers a variety of options for everyone, whether you're a
            beginner or an experienced cook. Whether you're just browsing or
            looking for your next dish to try, we hope you enjoy exploring the
            site as much as we enjoyed building it. Building this website has
            been a great experience for us, and we hope you’ll enjoy it as much
            as we’ve enjoyed creating it.

            Hey, I’m Lidia and my favorite recipe is the Chickpea Bowl. I love
            it because it is so simple, healthy and full of flavor. The
            combination of roasted chickpeas, fresh veggies, and a creamy
            dressing is just perfect. I can make it when it has to be quick and
            all of my friends like it a lot too. Plus, it’s super adjustable
            because you can add whatever toppings you like. I hope you enjoy
            making it as much as I do!

            Hi, I’m Anna! If I had to choose my absolute favorite recipe, it
            would definitely be the Tuna Salad. What makes it so great for me is
            how easy it is to customize. I can just add different veggies,
            proteins, or dressings, and somehow it still turns out delicious
            every time. It’s quick to prepare and easy to prepare for on the
            way. You should try it and I’m sure you’ll enjoy it just as much as
            I do! Have fun

            We belive that good food connects people.<br />Our secret? A bit of
            passion and a lot of love for detail, and recipes that really work
            out great. We don't want to create a space for perfection. We want
            to create a place for creativity, shared moments, and enjoyment. We
            want to inspire more and more people to cook and bake by themselves,
            regardless if you're a beginner or a chef. Cooking can be super easy
            and fun, because food is more than just food. It is culture,
            memories, and it builds connections. We hope that our recipes help
            you to experience a little bit of joy every day. Every dish tells a
            story and we want you to be part of it. Our kitchen is open for
            experiments, traditions and everything in between. So grab a spoon,
            turn up the music and let’s make something delicious together.
