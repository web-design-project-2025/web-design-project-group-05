            <br><strong>Hej! </strong></br> We are Alina, Anna and Lidia, three students who are currently
            studying in Sweden.<br />This website started as part of a
            university project. The goal was to build a recipe platform and
            since we all enjoy cooking and baking a lot, it quickly became
            something we were super excited about. We focused on creating a
            simple and accessible space where everyone can find inspiration and
            try out new ideas in the kitchen. We hope that the collection of
            recipes offers a variety of options for everyone, whether you're a
            beginner or an experienced cook. Whether you're just browsing or
            looking for your next dish to try, we hope you enjoy exploring the
            site as much as we enjoyed building it. Building this website has
            been a great experience for us, and we hope you’ll enjoy it as much
            as we’ve enjoyed creating it.

            Hey, I’m Lidia and my favorite recipe is the
            <strong>Chickpea Bowl</strong>. I love it because it is so simple,
            healthy and full of flavor. The combination of roasted chickpeas,
            fresh veggies, and a creamy dressing is just perfect. I can make it
            when it has to be quick and all of my friends like it a lot too.
            Plus, it’s super adjustable because you can add whatever toppings
            you like. I hope you enjoy making it as much as I do!

            Hi, I’m Anna! If I had to choose my absolute favorite recipe, it
            would definitely be the <strong>Tuna Salad</strong>. What makes it
            so great for me is how easy it is to customize. I can just add
            different veggies, proteins, or dressings, and somehow it still
            turns out delicious every time. It’s quick to prepare and easy for
            on the way. You should try it and I’m sure you’ll enjoy it! Have
            fun!

            <strong>We belive that good food connects people.</strong><br />Our
            secret? A bit of passion and a lot of love for detail, and recipes
            that really work out great. We don't want to create a space for
            perfection. We want to create a place for creativity, shared
            moments, and enjoyment. We want to inspire more and more people to
            cook and bake by themselves, regardless if you're a beginner or a
            chef. Cooking can be super easy and fun, because food is more than
            just food. It is culture, memories, and it builds connections. We
            hope that our recipes help you to experience a little bit of joy
            every day. Every dish tells a story and we want you to be part of
            it. Our kitchen is open for experiments, traditions and everything
            in between. So grab a spoon, turn up the music and let’s make
            something delicious together.
