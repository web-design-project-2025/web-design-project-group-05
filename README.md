## 1. Feature description

### Filter option

You can filter the recipes after these categories:

- vegan
- vegetarian
- gluten free
- lactose free
- spicy

If you tick the checkbox of the category you want, only those recipes that fit the filter option will be displayed. You can either decide to filter only the recipes in a certain category or you can filter through all the recipes on the "All Recipes" page to see which suit your diet best.

### Search bar

Next to the filter options is the search bar, in which you can type in ingredients that you like or still have at home and then all the recipes with this ingredient will show.

### Shopping list

On the shopping list page you can type in any item that you want to buy in the store and by either pressing the "Add" button or enter, the item will get added to the shopping list. By clicking on the added item, you will remove this item. If you want to delete the whole shopping list, then you can simply just click on the garbage icon to delete all items. The best part is, that the items are saved in the local storage. That means that you can come back later to your recipe website again to complete the shopping list!

### Notes

On the recipe page is a note section where you can write down anything you want. Wether you want to know that you need more flour the next time or that you need to take the double amount for your family. The notes will be saved in the local storage, which means that you will have them the next time again when you cook this recipe a second time.

### Food Orakle

The "Food Orakle" is one of our highligts. Maybe you have found yourself in the situation where you just could not decide what you want to eat for dinner tonight. No problem! With the "Food Orakle" you just choose a category in which you need a recipe and then you click on the card. The card will turn around and it will show you a random recipe from this category. By clicking on the recipe you will get directly directed to the recipe so that you can start cooking right away. If you dont like the recipe though, you can start over again and turn around another recipe.

### Save Recipes

To collect your favorite recipes, you can just click on the saved icon on eiter the recipe itself or on the overview page of all the recipes and add it directly to the saved page. From there you can delete the items or go to the recipe to cook or bake it.

## 2. How to use our website

### Homepage

On the homepage you will see all of our category that you can choose from or you click the button in the top right corner that says "View all Recipes". Then you will direcly be directed to the page where you will see all recipes. When you scroll further down on the homepage, you will see our "Food Orakle" with the three most popular categories. If you want to use the "Food Orakle" in other categories, you just go to the "Food Orakle" in the header menu.

### Category page

If you click on a category (e.g. Soups) then you will get directed to the soup page where you can see all the available soup recipes. On this overview page you can see the name, the time (how long it takes) and you can also save the recipe from there. If you click on a recipe, you will get to the specific recipe.

### Recipe page

On this page, you will have the possibility to check out the Nutrition facts if you want to by clicking on the button with the "+". In the second row are all the ingredients and instruction listed. One very cool feature is that you can click on the ingredients or the instruction steps to mark it as completed. By clicking again, it gets unselected again. Furter down is the Note section, where you can take your notes.
